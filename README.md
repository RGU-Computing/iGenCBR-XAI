## Examples
### Explainable Weather Forecasts Through an LSTM-CBR Twin System


- Created an LSTM-CBR twin system for explaining time-series forecastsâ€‹
- Proved that using LSTM feature embeddings improves CBR explanationsâ€‹
- Showed how visualisations and NLG can help enrich the explanations given
